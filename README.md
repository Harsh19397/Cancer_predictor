# Cancer_predictor

Helo everyone, I have build a cancer predictor with the help of the dataset provided by sklearn library. I have implement machine learning algorithms as given below:
      1. Linear Regression
      2. Logistic Regression
      3. Support Vector Machine Classifier
      4. K Nearest Neighbour Classifier
      5. Decision Tree Classifier
      6. Random Forest Classifier
      7. XGBoost
     
Along with these Machine Learning algorithms I have also implemented the neural network and then have compared their accuracies. 

You can install the dependancies and then can run the createModel.py file to check the results.
